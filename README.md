# RFM-analysis-SQL
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a technique used in customer relationship management (CRM) to identify and prioritize the most 
valuable customers for a business. It is based on the idea that the value of a customer to a business can be measured by three factors: recency (how recently the customer made a purchase), frequency (how often the customer makes purchases), and monetary value (how much the customer spends). By analyzing these three factors, a business can identify its most valuable customers and tailor its marketing efforts accordingly. 
For example, a business may want to focus its marketing efforts on customers who have made a purchase recently, make frequent purchases, and spend a lot of money, as these customers are likely to be the most valuable to the business. RFM analysis can be a useful tool for identifying opportunities to increase sales and improve customer retention.
The purpose of this project was to perform an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on sales data using SQL in order to identify the most valuable customers for a business.
To begin the analysis, the recency value for each customer was calculated by finding the number of days between the most recent purchase made by the customer and the current date. The frequency value was calculated by counting the number of purchases made by the customer within a given time period, such as the past year. The monetary value was calculated by summing the total amount spent by the customer within a given time period.
Next, the customers were ranked based on their RFM values using the RANK() function in SQL. A report was then created that displayed the RFM values and rankings for each customer using the SELECT statement and GROUP BY clause.
The results of the RFM analysis showed that the most valuable customers were those who had made a purchase recently, made frequent purchases, and spent a lot of money. Based on these findings, the business can tailor its marketing efforts towards these customers in order to increase sales and improve customer retention.
Overall, the RFM analysis was a useful tool for identifying opportunities to increase sales and improve customer retention. It allowed the business to identify its most valuable customers and tailor its marketing efforts accordingly.
